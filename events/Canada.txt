The key points of the legislation are:Giving the House of Commons the power to decide whether a proposed referendum question was considered clear before the public vote;Giving the House of Commons the power to determine whether or not a clear majority had expressed itself following any referendum vote, implying that some sort of supermajority is required for success;Stating that all provinces and the First Nations were to be part of the negotiations;Allowing the House of Commons to override a referendum decision if it felt the referendum violated any of the tenets of the Clarity Act. It was passed by the House on March 15th,2000."
